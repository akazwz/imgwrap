It is built using Remix and Cloudflare, enabling users to upload and share images easily. This service is free and open-source, with the source code accessible via the right header link for those interested in deploying their own instance. If you find it useful, consider giving it a star on GitHub. For any questions or suggestions, please feel free to create an issue on GitHub.
